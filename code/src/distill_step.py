"""The core on-policy distillation math: per-token reverse KL -> advantage -> loss.

Faithful to the Thinking Machines / Tinker `incorporate_kl_penalty` recipe:

    reverse_kl_t = log pi_student(y_t | y_<t) - log pi_teacher(y_t | y_<t)
    advantage_t  = - kl_coef * reverse_kl_t                     # negative reverse KL
    loss         = - mean_t [ stop_grad(advantage_t) * ratio_t ]
    ratio_t      = exp( log pi_student_new(y_t) - stop_grad(log pi_student_old(y_t)) )

`ratio_t` is the importance weight of the *current* student against the student that
generated the rollout. On fresh (on-policy) rollouts ratio ~= 1 and the loss reduces to the
intuitive `-(advantage * logp_new).mean()`; the ratio is what lets us reuse slightly stale
rollouts from the buffer without bias (PPO-style).

Alignment (see teacher_client): `teacher_logp` has length T and is aligned to `token_ids`
(element t = teacher log-prob of token t). A model's own per-token log-probs have length
T-1 (index i = log-prob of token i+1), so we compare against `teacher_logp[1:]`.
Completion tokens y_t live at sequence positions [prompt_len, T-1], i.e. log-prob indices
[prompt_len-1, T-2].

TWO CONDITIONING FIXES IN THIS VERSION
--------------------------------------
1. **Outlier clamping.** Per-token reverse KL between a 4B student and a 9B teacher is
   heavy-tailed: a handful of tokens carry tens of nats. With a global
   `clip_grad_norm_(1.0)`, those few tokens consumed the entire step budget and the rest of
   the sequence contributed essentially nothing. `rkl_clip` bounds each token's credit.
2. **Batch whitening.** Advantages are now centred and scaled across the whole batch
   (`whiten_advantages`). The batch mean acts as a baseline -- standard practice in policy
   gradient, and what makes the update well conditioned instead of a uniformly negative
   push. Note this is a deliberate departure from the raw Tinker objective: it changes the
   *scale* and adds a baseline, so `kl_coef` becomes a pure temperature on an already
   normalised signal. Set `whiten=False` to recover the unnormalised recipe.
