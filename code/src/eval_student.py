"""Before / after / teacher evaluation of the distillation student, using Inspect AI.

The companion to `train_distill.py`: it measures whether on-policy distillation actually
moved the student. Three phases, the *same* task, prompt and samples for each:

    before   ->  the pristine base student from the Hub   (EVAL_BASE_MODEL)
    after    ->  the checkpoint the Job wrote on FSx      (EVAL_FT_MODEL_DIR)
    teacher  ->  the served teacher, through its OpenAI-compatible endpoint

WHY THE TEACHER IS A PHASE, NOT A FOOTNOTE
------------------------------------------
On-policy distillation cannot take the student past the teacher, so `after - before` on its
own is uninterpretable: a +3 point move is excellent if the teacher is only 5 points ahead
and dismal if it is 40 ahead. The teacher phase turns the result into the quantity that
actually reflects how well distillation worked:

    headroom_recovered = (after - before) / (teacher - before)

CHOOSING THE TASK AND SAMPLE COUNT
----------------------------------
Pick a task with real headroom for the student: GSM8K for the 0.8B (base 52% vs teacher
94.5%), MATH-500 for a 4B (GSM8K saturates above 80% there). Always evaluate the whole test
set -- at n=100 the standard error is ~+-5pp, wider than most distillation gains; at
GSM8K's n=1319 it is ~+-1.4pp.

Prompt construction, answer extraction and answer equivalence all come from `prompts.py`,
the *same* module `train_distill.py` uses. That is deliberate: the
original code had two independent copies of the prompt format, they drifted, and the student
was optimised in a format it was never evaluated in.

Run all three phases in one pod::

    python3 eval_student.py --phase all \
        --base-model Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B \
        --ft-model-dir /fsx/opd/gsm8k-opd/student-final \
        --teacher-url http://teacher-vllm:8000/v1 --teacher-model Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B \
        --task gsm8k --limit 1319 --output-dir /fsx/opd/eval-gsm8k-opd

Outputs, all under ``$EVAL_DIR``:

* ``summary.json``          -- per-phase accuracy/stderr, secondary metrics, the
                              before->after ``delta_accuracy``, ``transitions``
                              (fixed / broken / both_correct / both_wrong) and
                              ``headroom_recovered``.
* ``samples_<phase>.jsonl`` -- one row per eval sample (answer, correct, output tokens,
                              format compliance) -- input to the comparison dashboard.
* ``logs/<phase>/``         -- full Inspect logs (``inspect view --log-dir ...``).

The same payload is printed between ``DASHBOARD_BEGIN``/``DASHBOARD_END`` sentinels so the
notebook can rebuild the dashboard from ``kubectl logs job/opd-student-eval`` alone.

Scoring is by *semantic* answer equivalence, not string equality (see
`prompts.answers_equivalent`): spelling ('1,000' / '$1000'), notation ('3/4' / '0.75' /
'\\frac{3}{4}'), decoration ('50%', '\\left') and wording ('seventy-two' / '72') do not cost
a point. Each row's ``match`` field and the per-phase ``lenient_matches`` count say how much
accuracy came from the tolerant paths.
