"""Pre-flight checks -- run these before spending GPU-hours on a distillation run.

Every check here corresponds to a failure that is either silent (the run completes and the
metrics look plausible, but the result is meaningless) or expensive (the teacher will not
start at all, twenty minutes into loading its weights).

    python3 preflight.py                       # all checks
    python3 preflight.py --skip-teacher        # config/memory only, no cluster needed

Checks:
  1. tensor-parallel divisibility -- a teacher whose KV heads are not divisible by TP simply
     cannot be served at that TP, and vLLM only tells you after loading.
  2. teacher quantisation + memory fit at TP on the target GPU. Two gates before the
     arithmetic: the method must still be in the serving build's registry (vLLM deleted
     bitsandbytes), and the GPU must meet the scheme's minimum compute capability (an FP8
     checkpoint needs sm_89 and A10G is sm_86 -- both failures happen minutes into pod
     startup, which is the expensive place to find them).
  3. shared tokenizer -- the teacher is scored by raw token id, so a differing tokenizer
     means it scores different text than the student generated. Silent and fatal.
  4. GPU topology -- A10G has no NVLink, so TP all-reduce crosses PCIe; `SYS` links are
     far worse than `PHB`/`PXB` and worth knowing about before blaming the trainer.
  5. teacher echo-logprobs actually populated -- the single failure that turns the
     advantage into self-reinforcement and produced the original ~6% result.
  6. student training memory fit for the chosen precision.
  7. train/eval prompt-format agreement.
  8. the single-node GPU partition -- teacher TP x REPLICAS + trainer + sampler must fit
     NODE_GPUS. With teacher and student sharing one ml.g5.24xlarge this is the constraint
     that decides whether anything runs at all, and getting it wrong shows up as a pod stuck
     Pending forever rather than as an error. As shipped (TP=2 x 1) the partition is
     2 + 1 + 1 = 4 of 4, exactly full.
