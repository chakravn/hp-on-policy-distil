"""Single source of truth for prompt format and answer extraction.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
The first version of this project built its training prompt in `train_distill.py`
(``apply_chat_template`` on a *base* tokenizer, which silently fell back to a bare
``question + "\\n"``) and its eval prompt in `eval_student.py` (a preamble + 4 worked
examples + ``"Question: ...\\nAnswer:"``). The student was therefore optimised in a
format it was never evaluated in, and never learned the ``#### <number>`` marker the
scorer looks for. That single mismatch swallowed most of the measured gain.

Both the trainer and the eval now import `build_prompt` / `extract_answer` from here, so
the two *cannot* drift again. If you change a prompt, you change it once.

TASK SPECS
----------
`TASK_SPECS` carries one entry per benchmark. Choose the one with real headroom for the
student: `gsm8k` for a 0.8B (base 52% vs teacher 94.5%), `math500` for a 4B, which already
saturates GSM8K. `gsm8k_native` is GSM8K in Qwen's zero-shot \\boxed{} format.

THINKING MODE
-------------
`build_prompt(..., enable_thinking=)` is threaded all the way through because a reasoning
model's chat template injects a ``<think>`` block. If the teacher is conditioned with
thinking on and the student generates with it off (or vice versa), the two token streams
diverge *structurally* and the per-token reverse KL between them is meaningless. Pin it
identically on both sides; the default is off, which also keeps rollouts short enough to
score affordably.
