"""Teacher scoring client for on-policy distillation.

The teacher's only job is to return, for a sequence the *student* generated, the
teacher's log-probability of every token. That single scalar per token is all we need to
compute the per-token reverse KL that supervises the student, and it is cheap enough to
send over the wire -- which is exactly why the teacher can live on its own GPU pool (a
vLLM inference Service: here one bf16 9B sharded over TP=2, reachable as a Service that can be
scaled to more replicas without the trainer noticing) instead of in the trainer process.

Two backends, same interface (`score(token_ids) -> list[float]`):

  * RemoteTeacher  -- talks to a vLLM OpenAI-compatible server. Uses `echo=True,
                      logprobs=1` to read back the log-prob of each *prompt* token, and
                      scores many sequences concurrently (`score_batch`).
  * LocalTeacher   -- loads the teacher in-process with transformers. Zero infra, used as
                      the de-risking fallback and for the unit check that the remote path
                      returns the same numbers.

Alignment convention (shared by both backends): the returned list has the same length as
`token_ids`; element t is  log p_teacher(token_ids[t] | token_ids[:t]). Element 0 is
undefined (no context) and is returned as 0.0 -- it is always masked out downstream
because we only score completion tokens (t >= prompt_len).

TWO SILENT-FAILURE MODES THIS FILE NOW GUARDS
---------------------------------------------
1. **Null logprobs.** vLLM does not populate echoed prompt logprobs under every
   version/flag combination. The old code mapped `None -> 0.0`, which turns the advantage
   into ``-kl_coef * log pi_student`` -- a *positive* advantage on the student's own
   samples, i.e. pure self-reinforcement rather than distillation. `teacher_kl` still
   printed a falling curve while accuracy went nowhere. We now raise instead.
2. **Vocabulary mismatch.** `score()` sends raw token ids. If the teacher and student do
   not share a tokenizer, the teacher scores *different tokens* than the student
   generated and the KL is meaningless, with no error anywhere. Call
   `assert_shared_vocabulary()` once at startup.
